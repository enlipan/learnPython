Why does "test" and "test"return "test"or 1 and 1return 1 instead of True?
Python and many languages like it return one of the operands to their boolean expressions
rather than just Trueor False.
 This means that if you did False and 1, then you get the fi rst operand (False),
 but if you do True and 1, then you get the second (1).
